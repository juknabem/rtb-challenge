# rtb-challenge

welcome to my newest project!

this project was developed as part of the job application to the junior technical solutions engineer position at rtb house.

to execute it, follow the next steps:
1 - download all the dependencies of the project (npm i);
2 - go to: backend > controller and execute the file ordersServer.js (node ordersServer.js);
3 - in another terminal screen, go to the 'frontend' file and run 'npm start', so the react app can open automatically;
4 - enjoy ;)

if any doubts or suggestions, you can contact through my email: juliaknabem@gmail.com

hope you like it! ;)
